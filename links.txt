                <p>While Clippers’ fans were excited to see DeAndre Jordan finally selected for an All Star game, his actual impact in the game was low. He played a mere 13 minutes, tied for second least on each team, behind an about-to-be-traded DeMarcus Cousins. With Anthony Davis dunking everything in sight and exploding for an All Star record 52 points, there simply wasn’t time to play DJ extended minutes. While there was some thought that he could dominate the East’s weak frontcourt, that very weakness enabled Steve Kerr to play other players. The West won 192-182, not like the result matters anyway.

Previous All Star games have usually featured a tight game down the stretch, where real defense is played and effort is expended. That didn’t happen tonight, as the game was a dunk line from start to finish. The players clearly didn’t care (outside of Russell Westbrook and Giannis Antetokounmpo), but at least nobody got injured.

DeAndre was fine in his 13 minutes of time, throwing down a thunderous jam and grabbing a few rebounds, but didn’t play enough to make much of an imprint. I hope he gets to make another couple games, but I’m sure the experience was still amazing for him.

Meanwhile, the All Star game was completely forgotten by the end of the 4th quarter as Twitter got wind of a potential DeMarcus Cousins deal that soon manifested itself as an absolute heist for New Orleans. An Anthony Davis-Cousins pairing will certainly be dominant in the paint, and a nightmare to play for any opponent. It’s a good thing the Clippers already played all three of their games with the Pels this season.	</p>

                    <small> Alan Anderson</small>

                <p>Kenneth Armstrong: B-</p>

It seems like we've been waiting all season for the moment when Anderson breaks into the rotation on a permanent basis. That, of course, has yet to happen. When he does play, however, he tends to bring good energy and moves well on defense, which relates to why his grade is in this range for me. The team seems to love "AA," and we have even seen the Clippers organization feature him on their website as the "hype man" who keeps spirits tight with unique and complex handshakes. As long as the Clippers don't have to depend on him for on-court production, he will continue to fit in well.	</p>
            <p>Max Jeffrey: C-</p>

Evaluating Alan Anderson with a letter grade almost feels unfair. Of the 56 games that the Clippers have played so far this season, Anderson has only been in 23 of them. And in those games, he's averaging a mere 11.6 minutes of playing time. Gauging his overall impact on the team is difficult given such a small sample size, but he just cannot be granted anything beyond a C-. While he looks like a decent fit when he actually does play, the numbers don’t lie. He ranks third from last on the team in Net Rating (-7.9), Defensive Rating (110.7), and True Shooting Percentage (47.2%). In addition, Anderson is shooting just 35.7% from the field and 30.8% from beyond the arc. For a defensive-minded shooting guard, these stats are simply all less than ideal. If there are any moves to be made by the deadline, we might see at least an uptick in his minutes. In the meantime, however, Anderson will have to find ways to earn some more playing time.</p>

<p>On one hand, I don’t think anyone was expecting Alan Anderson to be a crucial part of the Clippers’ success this year. On the other hand, he was a solid rotation player just two seasons ago, and the exact type of player (3 and D wing) that the Clippers have needed desperately over the past several years. Anderson simply hasn’t made an impact of any kind on the Clippers this season, whether for good or bad. He started off the year rehabbing for an injury, and Doc brought him along slowly. But even when injuries started to mount in December, Doc never gave him a real chance in the rotation. The idea of “saving him for the playoffs” when talking about a 34 year old reserve is ridiculous, so he just must not have stood out enough in practices to get more minutes. When he has played, Anderson has been mostly fine. He puts forth effort on the court, has made a few threes, and shown flashes of strong defense, especially recently. More importantly, everyone loves him in the locker room, and that’s important on a team like the Clippers, where not everything is sunshine and roses all the time. Hopefully the fact that he has been in the rotation the past three games (and played decently) is a harbinger of things to come.</p>
